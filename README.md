This program procedurally generates images for use as desktop backgrounds, screen-savers, or whatever strikes your fancy.

Includes a front end for determining image size and defining the number of images to be generated per use.

Loads of different image creation functions. Near infinite variation. Not too chaotic as to be siezure inducing.
